Project File Introduction
This project consists of the following key files and folders:
server.js
Purpose: The server.js file is the core of the application, responsible for:
Setting up the Express server and middleware.
Configuring Facebook OAuth authentication using Passport.js.
Defining RESTful API routes for managing recipes (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Functionalities:
Facebook Authentication:
Configured using passport-facebook strategy.
facebookAuth object contains:
clientID: Your Facebook App Client ID.
clientSecret: Your Facebook App Client Secret.
callbackURL: The URL for Facebook to redirect after successful login.
Moved sensitive data to environment variables (FACEBOOK_CLIENT_ID, FACEBOOK_CLIENT_SECRET, CALLBACK_URL).

MongoDB Connection:
Connects to MongoDB using the mongodb library.
The mongourl variable holds the MongoDB connection string.
MongoDB URL is now stored in an environment variable (MONGO_URI) for security.
